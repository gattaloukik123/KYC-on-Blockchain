# KYC on Blockchain
We all know how difficult it is for a normal user to get his KYC data verified from any third party source or banks. Privacy will always be treated as a joke until technologies such as Bloackchain, IPFS are rapidly used in daily life applications. We made a KYC application that uses blockchain as a database which ensures security and privacy of a user. This application is deployed and tested on a local test network such as Ganache using truffle and web3.js.
